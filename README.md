# Pokedex Webpage

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a Pokedex webpage using the React framework allowing them to search for and retrieve detailed information about their favorite Pokemon, as well as keep track of the Pokemon they have "caught". The primary objective is to demonstrate proficiency in building modern web applications using React, leveraging its component-based architecture, state management techniques, and API integration.

## Requirements
1. Implement a search feature allowing users to search for Pokemon by name or relevant criteria using the official PokeAPI.
2. Display relevant details of the searched Pokemon, such as name, type, abilities, stats, and an image.
3. Implement a feature to "catch" Pokemon and manage the list of caught Pokemon using Zustand for state management.
4. Build the webpage using React's component-based architecture for modularity and reusability.
5. Integrate with the PokeAPI to fetch Pokemon data using the fetch API.
6. Use the specified UI component library for building UI elements.
7. Deploy the webpage to a hosting platform or service for accessibility.

## Expected Outcomes
1. A fully operational Pokedex webpage showcasing mastery of React's core concepts.
2. Implementation of a search feature with pagination for searching Pokemon.
3. Successful integration with the PokeAPI to fetch data about searched Pokemon.
4. Proper rendering and display of detailed Pokemon information.
5. Implementation of catching Pokemon and maintaining a list of caught Pokemon.
6. Effective utilization of Zustand for state management.
7. Well-structured and modular codebase adhering to React's component-based architecture.
8. Separation of concerns and component reusability.
9. Proper handling of asynchronous data fetching and error management.
10. A visually appealing and user-friendly interface across different devices.
11. Deployment of the Pokedex webpage to a hosting platform or service.
